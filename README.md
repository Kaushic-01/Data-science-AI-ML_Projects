#My_SQL_Pixar_Film_Project
Analysis on Pixar Films MY SQl
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Pixar films using a MySQL database. 
The repository contains a SQL script that performs various queries to explore and
analyze different aspects of Pixar's filmography, including box office performance, critical and audience reception, genre, and Academy Award recognition.

Key Features of the Analysis:
Box Office Performance: Identify the highest-grossing films, calculate average worldwide gross by genre, and analyze profitability.

Critical and Audience Reception: Compare Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores, find the films with the highest ratings, and determine the average scores for award-winning films.

Film & People Data: List directors and their films, identify directors who have helmed multiple projects, and find the most credited people on a film.

Award Recognition: Count Academy Award wins and nominations per film, identify films that have won multiple awards, and find films with nominations but no wins.

Genre and Film Attributes: Explore unique genres and sub-genres, calculate the average runtime for different film ratings, and find films released within specific decades.

Advanced SQL Techniques: The analysis utilizes various SQL concepts, including joins, subqueries, window functions (e.g., RANK(), LEAD()), conditional aggregation, and data manipulation (ALTER TABLE, UPDATE).

This project is a great resource for anyone interested in SQL, data analysis, or a deep dive into the world of Pixar films. The queries are well-commented and structured to be easily understood and adapted for further analysis.
